In the paper I was a bit simplistic with pure data secret ingredents.

Instead of mixing it with the other ingredients, I should have cyclicly
XORed it with the intermediate keystream $K_i$.

Thus $K'_i = F(K_i, SI_i)$ where $F = K_i \oplus SI_i$ and $SI_i$ is an
circular buffer with the data secret ingredient.

Then the attacker will have to guess the complete secret ingredient, 
instead of sequentially searching a subspace of it.
